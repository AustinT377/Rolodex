Contacts sample app


This is a sample application that was build in a few hours as takehome assignment. 

Functional Requirements:
You should be able to list all of the user’s contacts, even if there are thousands.
The user shouldn’t have to wait a long time while all of the contacts load, since they won’t all be on-screen ;).
The user should have some information or indication in the UI while particular data is loading or if it is not available.
Please build a custom listing - do not use the ContactsUI framework (CNContactPickerViewController or CNContactPicker) or the deprecated AddressBookUI framework.
Your custom contact cell should show the contact’s name and their address’ distance from the user’s location. It should also have a button that should allow the user to send a message to the contact (to the phone number or email, no need to support both - for this you can present a native modal message compose view controller).
Make sure these components lay out cleanly together (show us you know how to use auto-layout in your custom cell).
